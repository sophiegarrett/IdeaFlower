# IdeaFlower
A project that I started but never finished. The idea was to build a platform for users to freely share ideas, which could then be implemented by other users.
These implementations could, in theory, then be tracked by the idea's creator, fostering a community of thinkers and doers, all working towards the common good.

It was a fun idea, but I quickly realized that I was in way over my head and abandoned the project. If anyone else wants to pick up where I left off,
feel free (and I'd be glad to help)!
